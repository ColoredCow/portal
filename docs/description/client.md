  What is channel partner?
  - At ColoredCow, when there is a company that is already a client and has multiple projects, ColoredCow collaborates with the client and works on their behalf. In this scenario, the ColoredCow team members are referred to as the client's team members for those specific projects. This partnership is commonly known as a channel partnership.
  
  What are parent organizations and departments?
  - In the context of the ColoredCow portal, the parent organization refers to the main company associated with the client. It could be a company or an institution under which the client operates. 
  - Department, on the other hand, refers to the specific division or unit within the client's organization that is engaging with ColoredCow for services or projects.
  - For Example :
    - ColoredCow currently has Google as a client. Now, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, wishes to work ColoredCow for a project. To reflect this, we would include 'Alphabet' in the parent organization option for Google.
