## Guidelines for chat room

### 1. Write an effective daily progress report

A daily progress report is an internal glimpse into your day, and it serves a good purpose. All you need to do is take your mentor by the hand and walk him through your day. This gives you a better sense of how you’re pacing things. Additionally, it will help you to learn and get better at your job.

Just as weekly reports dive into a weekly review, writing daily reports will cover a complete review of your day. These looks into:

* **The Past:**

A quick recap of what covered in the entire day(notable achievements of the day + challenges encountered).

* **The Present:**

This will cover about what you are presently working on?

* **The Future:**

Plans for the coming day.

So you’re willing to give a snapshot of your day. The real question is – when and how?

Just post your snapshot at the end of your day between 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM in our chat room.

### 2. Whom and when you can tag someone

* Only tag someone using the `@` sign when you need a quick response from a specific person. If you have a general question, update, and suggestion, avoid taking directly. Alerting people can be very annoying.

* ColoredCow-Portal community is not like a public bulletin board system, you don’t need to @ mention a person’s name to get them to read a message.  Google chat highlights channels with new messages and people should be scanning through them periodically.
