## Installation Guidelines :rocket:

1. Clone this repository and move to `portal` directory
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/coloredcow-portal/portal
   cd portal
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

3. npm build
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
    A possible error may arise with `cross-env`. So try running the following commands.
   - To clear a cache in npm, we need to run the npm cache command in our terminal and install cross-env.
   ```sh
   npm cache clear --force
   npm install cross-env
   
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```


4. Copy `.env.example` as `.env`


5. Run the following command to add a key
   ```sh
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Add the following settings in `.env` file:
    1. Laravel app configurations
    ```sh
    APP_NAME="ColoredCow Portal"
    APP_ENV=local
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_URL=http://portal.test
    ```

    2. Database configurations
     Make sure you have a database created in your local server. For more info check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4geOENi3--M).

9. Setup Virtual Host
    1. For XAMPP:
        - Go to `C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\` and open the `hosts` file in notepad (run as administrator). Add the following line at the end:
            ```
            127.0.0.1      portal.test
            ```

        - Go to `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf` and add the following code snippet at the end of the file. Copy the absolute file path for the `public` directory of the project and paste it below where `your_project_path` is written. For example, your project path may look like `C:/xampp/htdocs/portal/public`.
            ```apacheconf
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName portal.test
                DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/project"
                <Directory "/path/to/your/project">
                    DirectoryIndex index.php
                    AllowOverride All
                    Order allow,deny
                    Allow from all
                </Directory>
            </VirtualHost>
            ```
        - Restart XAMPP. Next, open this url in your browser: http://portal.test
    
    2. For MAMP(Mac OS)
        - Go to `etc/hosts` file or edit this in the terminal use the following command.
            ```sh
            sudo nano /etc/hosts
            ```
        - Add this line 
            ```
            127.0.0.1   portal.test
            ```

        - Go to `httpd.conf` file or edit this file in the terminal itself use this command
            ```sh
            sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
            ```
            And search for `vhosts` and uncomment line like this
            ```sh
            # Virtual hosts
            # Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
            ```
            Change above to:
            ```sh
            # Virtual hosts
            Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
            ```
          - And the go to vhost file in the terminal 
            ```sh
            sudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
            ```
            Add the following line at the end of the file: 
            Copy the absolute file path for the `public` directory of the project and paste it below where `your_project_path` is written. For example, your project path may look like `/Application/MAMP/htdocs/portal/public`.

            ```apacheconf
             <VirtualHost *:80>
                 ServerName portal.test
                 DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/project"
                 <Directory "/path/to/your/project">
                     DirectoryIndex index.php
                     AllowOverride All
                     Order allow,deny
                     Allow from all
                 </Directory>
             </VirtualHost>
            ```
          - Restart MAMP. Next, open this url in your browser: http://portal.test
          
10. Login to the portal using the newly created user in the database. Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php` and search for the `users` table and you can find the user email in it. The default password to log in is `12345678`.
